              <p>Quality, in the business sense, can be defined as conformance to customer specifications [ref]. As a test specialist, I was a steward of quality. Consequently, communication with my customers and team members was the key to sustaining successful relationships.</p>
              <p>It had not been easy to be the harbinger of bugs. I’ve learned from this career that it is paramount to have utmost constructive interactions, and always, have multiple alternative solutions at hand. Giving my stakeholders the freedom of choice is vital to customer engagement, inducing ownership pride and satisfaction.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, satisfaction is the goal of customer service.</p>

              <p>I have consistently taken opportunities to mentor because being human, I cannot do or remember everything. We do not have a <em>pensieve</em> like the one in Harry Potter’s world. The show must go on even when I’m sick!</p>
              <p>I have taught ladies how to code, tutored pre-teens on violin finesse, and guided teenage Canadian Air Cadets to positive self-discipline. Mentorship has been an awesome way to develop empathic relationships and learn a craft comprehensively. In turn, I also became a more effective teacher through the student’s feedback actions and his/her independent motivation for more education.</p>

              <p>From project management lectures, I learned that a successful project is 90% planning and 10% execution. A project takes 90% planning effort due to preparation of variations and alternatives to the plan. It’s like a <em>choose-your-own-adventure</em> story, but I always make sure there is value and a desirable ending.</p>
              <p>I enjoy managing work projects using efficient lean work processes, defining clear requirements, handling logistics, and meeting stakeholders’ expectations. Of course, working with a supportive team is most advantageous for successful projects.</p>

              <p> Presently, the flow of information trend towards more diverse mediums such as interactive web apps, videos, and even 3D prototypes construction. I recognize the library’s need to adjust its curation and presentation methods.</p>
              <p>I love going to the library because the knowledge is free, and I can explore it to my heart’s content. Like free cake and beer, free information tastes wonderful.</p>
              <p>Reading has been my most convenient preferred past time. Being constantly online, there’s always something interesting to learn. I read <a href="" data-toggle="popover" data-content="The news, Wired magazine, Design Observer, Malcolm Gladwell, Maclean’s Scott Feschuk for a chuckle, Karl Lagerfeld’s new Chanel collection, O’Reilly’s “Head first” technology series, etc. Bring it on!">everything!</a> I love <a href="" data-toggle="popover" data-content="My favourites are 99% Invisible, Freakanomics Radio, and HBR IdeaCast.">podcasts</a> too!</p>
              <p>My high capacity to learn has also benefitted my work. My co-workers did not believe I could learn and then test BBM’s behemoth system in 6 months. I proved it was possible and I was the first ever to finish a project on the team.</p>
              <p>In the same way, it has been rewarding to apply my new knowledge. Believe it or not, I’m practicing these <a href="" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Hint: This page is responsive. Resize it and see for yourself!">abilities</a> now!</p>

        <div class="row">          
          <div class="col-md-7">          
            <p><strong>Hello! My name is Janette.</strong></p>
            <p>Building and hacking things together have always been my calling. I started solving 300-piece jigsaw puzzles in an hour by the age of 4. My techie father also introduced me to computers early in my life. With his unconditional encouragement, I have explored fearlessly on the machines and the internet. I was amused with playing non-fancy, no-flash games like Carmen Sandiego and making Angelfire web pages. Remember those pages?! HTML/CSS have come a <em>long</em> way.</p>
            <p>Later, my father even made me build my own computer for university. All jokes aside, I still possess this skill and have recently replaced my notebook keyboard, after taking the whole thing apart for diagnostics.</p>
            <p>To no one’s surprise, I was destined to take engineering studies. I completed my undergraduate degree in Engineering Systems and Computing at the University of Guelph. Some of my awesome experiences included programming three-wheeled toy vehicles, writing my name with robotic arms, and making a CPU. And, of course, there were parties.</p>
            <p>My main profession have been software and large-scale system tester for the last few years. I was not wholeheartedly satisfied with this path and had an itch to pursue more training. Hence, I started graduate studies on a Masters of Engineering design at McMaster University. Studying design and innovation have been perfectly complimentary to my systems trade. Currently, I’m applying these concepts in my final graduate project on biometrics authentication.</p>
            <p>What’s my project about? Think never having to type in your password again because you have an epic victory dance. Intrigued? <a href="#contacts">Contact me</a> to find out!</p>
